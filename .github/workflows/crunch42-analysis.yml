# This workflow locates REST API file contracts
# (Swagger or OpenAPI format, v2 and v3, JSON and YAML)
# and runs 200+ security checks on them using 42Crunch Security Audit technology.
#
# Documentation is located here: https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following setup steps.
#
# 1. Create a free 42Crunch account at https://platform.42crunch.com/register
#
# 2. Follow steps at https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm
#    to create an API Token on the 42Crunch platform
#
# 3. Add a secret in GitHub as explained in https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm,
#    store the 42Crunch API Token in that secret, and supply the secret's name as api-token parameter in this workflow
